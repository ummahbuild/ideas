# Ideas Board

Welcome to the Ummah Build Ideas repository! This is a collection of project ideas aimed at serving the Muslim community.

## 📋 How It Works

Each idea is documented as a separate markdown file in the [`ideas/`](./ideas/) directory. These ideas can be linked to GitHub Projects to track their progress and development.

## 🎯 Current Ideas

- [🗄️ Mosque Database](./ideas/idea-003-mosque-database.md) - Open API for mosque information and prayer times

## 📊 Linking to GitHub Projects
