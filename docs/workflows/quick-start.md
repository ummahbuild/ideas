# Quick start: Build one idea in a weekend

Minimal path to go from “I want to build this” to a live MVP in a few days.

---

## Day 1: Define and scope

1. **Pick one idea** from the [board](https://ideas.ummah.build). Open its [idea page](https://ideas.ummah.build/idea/praysap/) and copy the description + first 5 requirements.
2. **One sentence:** “[Product] helps [who] [do what] so they can [outcome].”
3. **MVP = 3 features max.** Choose the 3 that matter most for v0.1. Drop the rest into “later.”
4. **Islamic check:** If it involves prayer, money, or religious content, skim the [Islamic authenticity](https://github.com/ummahbuild/ideas/blob/main/docs/templates/islamic-authenticity.md) template and note any sources or disclaimers you’ll need.

## Day 2: Build

5. **Name + one screen.** Pick a name (see [name/idea generation](https://github.com/ummahbuild/ideas/blob/main/docs/templates/name-idea-generation.md) if stuck). Build one core screen or flow (e.g. “find nearby mosque” or “log one prayer”).
6. **No auth yet** if you can avoid it (e.g. local storage, or “sign up later”).
7. **Deploy** to Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages so you have a URL.

---

## Day 3: Share and learn

8. **Share the URL** in one place: Muslim tech Twitter, a Discord, or a WhatsApp group. Ask: “Would you use this? What’s missing?”
9. **Fix one thing** from feedback and redeploy.
10. **Add to the board:** Open [Edit existing idea](https://github.com/ummahbuild/ideas/issues/new?template=edit_idea.md) or a PR to add your live URL and status to [ideas.json](https://github.com/ummahbuild/ideas/blob/main/ideas.json).

## If you have more time

- [Idea dissection](https://github.com/ummahbuild/ideas/blob/main/docs/templates/idea-dissection.md) – full problem/solution/users.
- [Go to market](https://github.com/ummahbuild/ideas/blob/main/docs/templates/go-to-market.md) – channels and first 90 days.
- [Launch checklist](https://github.com/ummahbuild/ideas/blob/main/docs/templates/launch-checklist.md) – before a proper launch.

See [Workflows README](README.md) for the full idea → production flows.
