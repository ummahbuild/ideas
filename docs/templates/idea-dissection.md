# Idea dissection template

Use this to break down an Islamic tech idea into clear parts before building or pitching.

## 1. One-line pitch

> [Product name] is a [category] that [key benefit] for [target user].

**Example:** PRAYSAP is a prayer app that connects Muslims to pray together and build habits for daily prayors.

---

## 2. Problem

- **What pain or need does this address?**
- **Who feels it most?** (segment: e.g. young professionals, parents, reverts)
- **How do people solve it today?** (workarounds, existing tools)
- **Why is the current solution insufficient?**

---

## 3. Solution

- **Core value proposition** (one sentence)
- **Key features** (3–5 must-haves; can paste from ideas.json `requirements`)
- **What makes it distinctly “Islamic” or faith-aligned?** (e.g. prayer times, halal compliance, community)

---

## 4. Users & personas

- **Primary user:** [name, context, goal]
- **Secondary user:** [if any]
- **Anti-user:** Who explicitly is not the target?

---

## 5. Scope (MVP vs later)

| In scope (MVP) | Out of scope (v2+) |
|----------------|--------------------|
|                 |                    |

---

## 6. Success criteria

- **Metric 1:** e.g. DAU, prayers logged, signups
- **Metric 2:** e.g. retention, NPS
- **Qualitative:** e.g. “Users say it helps them pray on time”

---

## 7. Open questions / risks

- [ ] Islamic authenticity: any fiqh or scholar review needed?
- [ ] Technical: dependencies, APIs, platforms?
- [ ] Market: who else is doing this?
