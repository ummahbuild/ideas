Launch strategy for an Islamic tech product.

## 1. Launch goal

- **Primary:** e.g. 1,000 signups in first 30 days
- **Secondary:** e.g. 5 app-store reviews, 3 community mentions

---

## 2. Target segment (first)

- Who exactly are you launching to first? (Use [Target personas](target-personas.md) if needed.)
- Where do they spend time online? (Apps, groups, influencers, events)

---

## 3. Channels (prioritized)

| Channel | Tactic | Owner / timeline |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| e.g. Twitter/X | Launch thread + tag Muslim tech accounts | Week 1 |
| e.g. Reddit / Discord | Post in r/islam, Muslim dev servers | Week 1 |
| e.g. Mosques / WhatsApp | Flyer or word-of-mouth in one city | Week 2–3 |
| e.g. Product Hunt / launch pages | Submit and ask community to upvote | Week 1 |

## 4. Messaging

- **Headline:** One line for ads and social (see [Messaging for personas](messaging-for-personas.md))
- **Story:** Why you built it, for whom, and what you want next (feedback, beta testers)

---

## 5. First 90 days

| Phase | Focus | Success metric |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| 0–30 days | Launch, first users, fix critical bugs | Signups, retention D1/D7 |
| 30–60 days | Feedback, one major improvement | NPS or qualitative feedback |
| 60–90 days | Double down on best channel, consider monetization or sustainability | Revenue or runway / next round |

## 6. Partnerships & communities

- **Muslim tech / startup groups:** Ummah.build, Muslim Devs, local incubators
- **Mosques or orgs:** Pilot with one mosque or Islamic org
- **Influencers / scholars:** Who can authentically mention the product?
