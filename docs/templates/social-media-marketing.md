# Social media & streamlined marketing template

Simple, repeatable social and content plan for Islamic tech launches.

## 1. Goals

- **Awareness:** Reach X people in first month
- **Conversion:** Signups / downloads / waitlist
- **Community:** Replies, DMs, shares (engagement)

---

## 2. Channels (pick 1–2 to start)

| Channel | Why | Post frequency | Owner |
|---------|-----|----------------|--------|
| Twitter/X | Muslim tech, founders, devs | 3–5/week | |
| Instagram | Visual, younger Muslims | 2–3/week | |
| LinkedIn | Professionals, B2B if relevant | 1–2/week | |
| TikTok | Short-form, viral potential | 2–3/week | |
| Reddit / Discord | Communities (r/islam, Muslim dev servers) | 1–2/week, not spammy | |

---

## 3. Content pillars

| Pillar | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Product** | Features, updates, how it works | “You can now block prayer times on your calendar.” |
| **User / social proof** | Testimonials, use cases | “Fatima from London uses PRAYSAP every day.” |
| **Islamic / value** | Faith-aligned, not preachy | “Why praying in congregation matters.” |
| **Behind the scenes** | Team, build, journey | “We’re building in the open. Here’s our roadmap.” |

## 4. Posting workflow

1. **Batch:** Create 5–10 posts in one sitting (use [Messaging for personas](messaging-for-personas.md)).
2. **Calendar:** Simple spreadsheet or Notion: date, channel, pillar, copy, asset.
3. **Review:** One person checks tone and Islamic alignment (see [Islamic authenticity](islamic-authenticity.md)).
4. **Schedule:** Buffer, Hootsuite, or native scheduler.
5. **Respond:** Reply to comments and DMs within 24h.

## 5. Launch week checklist

- [ ] Pinned post / bio updated with link and one-liner
- [ ] Launch thread (Twitter) or carousel (Instagram) with problem → solution → CTA
- [ ] Tag 3–5 relevant accounts (Muslim tech, mosques, influencers) — don’t spam
- [ ] Post in 1–2 communities (Reddit, Discord) with value-first message
- [ ] Ask early users to share or leave a review

---

## 6. Metrics (keep it simple)

- **Reach / impressions** per post
- **Engagement:** Likes, comments, shares
- **Clicks** to landing page or app (use UTM: `?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social`)
- **Signups** from social (track in analytics)
