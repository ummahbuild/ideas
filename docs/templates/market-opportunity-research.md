## 2. Market size (order of magnitude)

| Level | Description | Estimate / source |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|

| **SAM** (Serviceable Addressable) | Those in your geography/language/segment | e.g. English-speaking, US/UK/Canada |
| **SOM** (Serviceable Obtainable) | Realistic share in 1–3 years | e.g. 0.1% of SAM = 50K users |

## 4. Research methods

- [ ] **Interviews:** 5–10 target users (what they use now, what’s missing)
- [ ] **Survey:** Simple Typeform/Google Form (problem awareness, willingness to try)
- [ ] **Desk research:** Reports, app store rankings, search volume (e.g. “prayer app”, “zakat calculator”)
