# Islamic authenticity template

Checklist and process to align an Islamic tech product with Sharia and scholarly expectations.

## When to use

- Before building features that touch worship (e.g. prayer, zakat, halal)
- Before marketing claims about “Islamic” or “Sharia-compliant”
- When handling money, contracts, or religious content

---

## 1. Domain checklist

| Domain | Question | Status / notes |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **Worship** | Does it change or advise on acts of worship (prayer, fasting, zakat)? | |
| **Finance** | Does it handle money, interest, or contracts? | |
| **Content** | Does it display Quran, hadith, or fatwa? | |
| **Social** | Does it affect modesty, gender interaction, or family? | |
| **Food / health** | Does it certify or recommend halal? | |

---

## 2. Sources & methodology

- **Calculation methods:** Prayer times, zakat, inheritance — which madhab or method? Document it.
- **Content sources:** Quran/hadith — which edition, translator, or database? Are they credited?
- **Scholarly input:** Have any scholars or institutions been consulted? (Optional but strengthens trust.)

---

## 3. Red flags to avoid

- [ ] Implying a single “correct” fiqh position when there is ikhtilaf
- [ ] Offering fatwa or religious ruling without clear sourcing
- [ ] Handling donations or zakat without transparency or recognized oversight
- [ ] Mixing riba, gharar, or maysir in “Islamic” finance features
- [ ] Content or UX that contradicts widely accepted norms (e.g. modesty, family)

---

## 4. Transparency for users

- Show **calculation method** and **source** (e.g. “Prayer times: Muslim World League”).
- Provide **disclaimer** where appropriate (e.g. “Not a substitute for scholar advice”).
- Link to **terms**, **privacy**, and (if applicable) **zakat/charity policy**.

---

## 5. Review cadence

- **Pre-launch:** Run through this checklist and document decisions.
- **After major feature changes:** Re-check affected domains.
- **Ongoing:** If users or scholars raise concerns, document and address.
