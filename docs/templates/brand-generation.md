# Brand generation template

Define name, voice, and visual identity for an Islamic tech product.

## 1. Name (see also [Name / idea generation](name-idea-generation.md))

- **Shortlist:** 3–5 names
- **Criteria:** Memorable, easy to spell, available (domain, social handles), no negative meaning in Arabic/Urdu/other languages
- **Final choice:** 
- **Tagline:** One line under the name

---

## 2. Brand voice

| Dimension | Description | Example tone |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Voice** | e.g. Warm, clear, trustworthy, not preachy | “We’re here to help you pray on time” not “You must pray” |
| **Vocabulary** | Terms you use vs avoid | Use: “community”, “habit”; Avoid: “sin”, harsh language |
| **Audience** | Who you sound like you’re talking to | Young Muslims, global, English-first |

---

## 3. Visual identity (high level)

- **Colors:** Primary, secondary (and why — e.g. green for growth/peace, avoid red for alerts only)
- **Imagery:** Photos vs illustrations; avoid faces if needed for modesty
- **Logo:** Wordmark vs icon; works at small size (favicon, app icon)

---

## 4. Islamic alignment

- **How does the brand reflect Islamic values?** (e.g. honesty, community, simplicity)
- **What do you avoid?** (e.g. interest-based imagery, inappropriate content)
- **Tone with faith:** Encouraging and supportive, not judgmental

---

## 5. Consistency checklist

- [ ] Same name and tagline everywhere (app, web, social)
- [ ] Voice guidelines for copy (landing page, in-app, support)
- [ ] One set of colors and logo files for dev and marketing
