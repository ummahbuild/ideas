# Target personas template

Define who you’re building for so product and messaging stay focused.

## Persona 1 (primary)

- **Name / label:** e.g. “Busy Professional Fatima”
- **Demographics:** Age range, location, language, occupation
- **Faith context:** Practicing level, what they care about (prayer on time, halal food, community, etc.)
- **Tech context:** Devices, apps they use daily, comfort with new apps
- **Goal:** What do they want to achieve that your product helps with?
- **Pain:** What’s blocking them today?
- **Quote:** One sentence in their words (e.g. “I just need something that reminds me without being pushy.”)

---

## Persona 2 (secondary, optional)

- **Name / label:**
- **Demographics:**
- **Relevance to product:** Why they matter but aren’t the main focus
- **Goal & pain:**

---

## Anti-persona

- **Who we’re NOT building for:** e.g. “Someone who doesn’t care about prayer times at all”
- **Why:** So we don’t dilute the product for our core user

---

## Validation

- [ ] Have we talked to at least 3 people who fit Persona 1?
- [ ] Do our features and roadmap map to Persona 1’s goal and pain?
- [ ] Are we saying “no” to features that serve only anti-persona?
