# Community Events Platform

## 📄 Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Category**: Community  
**Date Created**: 2026-01-18  
**Contributors**: @ummahbuild

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Muslim communities often struggle to coordinate and communicate about local events effectively. Information is scattered across multiple platforms (WhatsApp groups, Facebook pages, mosque bulletin boards), making it difficult for community members to:
- Discover events happening in their area
- Keep track of important dates and gatherings
- RSVP and plan attendance
- Connect with event organizers

## 💡 Proposed Solution

A centralized web and mobile platform specifically designed for Muslim community events. The platform would allow mosques, Islamic centers, and community organizations to post events, and enable community members to discover, save, and attend events relevant to their interests.

## 👥 Target Audience

- **Primary users**: Muslim community members looking for local events
- **Secondary users**: Mosque administrators, event organizers, Islamic organizations
- **Community impact**: Strengthens community bonds through better event coordination and attendance

## ✨ Key Features

1. **Event Discovery**: Browse events by category (religious, educational, social, sports, youth)
2. **Smart Notifications**: Get reminders for saved events and prayer times
3. **RSVP & Attendance**: Easy registration and check-in for events
4. **Community Calendar**: View all upcoming events in a unified calendar
5. **Location-Based Search**: Find events near you using GPS
6. **Multi-Language Support**: Interface available in Arabic, Urdu, Turkish, and other languages
7. **Prayer Time Integration**: Automatic scheduling around prayer times
8. **Volunteer Coordination**: Sign up to help with event organization

## 🛠️ Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (mobile apps), React (web)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured data, Redis for caching
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud hosting (AWS/Azure), CDN for media

### Implementation Approach
1. Start with web MVP focusing on event posting and discovery
2. Add mobile apps for iOS and Android
3. Integrate with existing mosque management systems
4. Build admin dashboard for event organizers

### Challenges & Risks
- **User Adoption**: Need to onboard multiple mosques and organizations simultaneously
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring event information is accurate and up-to-date
- **Moderation**: Implementing community guidelines and content moderation

## 📊 Resources Needed
